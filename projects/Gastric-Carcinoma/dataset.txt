About this Dataset
Context
CT KIDNEY DATASET: Normal-Cyst-Tumor and Stone

Content
The dataset was collected from PACS (Picture archiving and communication system) from different hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh where patients were already diagnosed with having a kidney tumor, cyst, normal or stone findings. Both the Coronal and Axial cuts were selected from both contrast and non-contrast studies with protocol for the whole abdomen and urogram. The Dicom study was then carefully selected, one diagnosis at a time, and from those we created a batch of Dicom images of the region of interest for each radiological finding. Following that, we excluded each patient's information and meta data from the Dicom images and converted the Dicom images to a lossless jpg image format. After the conversion, each image finding was again verified by a radiologist and a medical technologist to reconfirm the correctness of the data.

Our created dataset contains 12,446 unique data within it in which the cyst contains 3,709, normal 5,077, stone 1,377, and tumor 2,283
